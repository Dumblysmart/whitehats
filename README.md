I want to join WhiteHats because I am genuinely interested in cybersecurity and want to actively participate in CTFs to strengthen my practical skills. Being part of this club would allow me to learn from experienced members, collaborate on real challenges, and continuously improve my problem-solving abilities. I also want to contribute to the growth of the community and represent the club in multiple competitions. I see WhiteHats not only as a platform for technical advancement, but also as a space that encourages teamwork and discipline.



I heard about the recent react next JS hack which gave attacker RCE(remote code execution) and also the recent mongo db bleed
